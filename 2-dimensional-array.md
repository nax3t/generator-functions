A 2-dimensional rectangular list (or array) is a list that contains other lists, with each sub-list having the same number of elements. It can be thought of as a table or a matrix, with the sub-lists representing rows and the elements within the sub-lists representing columns. For example, a 2-dimensional list with 3 rows and 4 columns would look like this:

```JS
[[1, 2, 3, 4],
 [5, 6, 7, 8],
 [9, 10, 11, 12]]
```
