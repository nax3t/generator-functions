A generator function in JavaScript is a special type of function that can be paused and resumed multiple times, allowing it to yield multiple values over time. A generator function is defined using the `function*` keyword and it can use the `yield` keyword to return a value and pause execution.

In this case, we want to write a generator function that accepts a 2-dimensional rectangular list as a parameter, and generates the sequence of elements returned one at a time of the transpose of the array navigated in row-first order. The input will be a 2-d rectangular list, such as [[1, 2, 3], [6, 5, 4]]. The output will be the sequence of the transpose. For the given example, the sequence is 1, 6, 2, 5, 3, 4.

To accomplish this, we can create a generator function that iterates over the columns of the rectangular list and for each column, it iterates over the rows, yielding the element of that column and row.

Here is an example of such a generator function:
```javascript
function* transposeGenerator(arr) {
    for (let i = 0; i < arr[0].length; i++) {
        for (let row of arr) {
            yield row[i];
        }
    }
}
```

We can use this generator function like this:
```javascript
let arr = [[1, 2, 3], [6, 5, 4]];
for (let element of transposeGenerator(arr)) {
    console.log(element);
}
```

This will output:

```javascript
1
6
2
5
3
4
```

As you can see, the generator function accepts the 2-dimensional rectangular list as a parameter and iterates over the columns and rows of the list, yielding the element of that column and row. This way, it generates the sequence of the transpose of the array navigated in row-first order.

In summary, generator functions are a powerful tool in JavaScript that allow you to generate a sequence of values over time, and it's easy to use them to transpose a 2-dimensional rectangular list and generate the sequence of elements returned one at a time of the transpose of the array navigated in row-first order.
